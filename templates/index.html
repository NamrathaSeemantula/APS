                Students find it difficult to connect with their Alumni. This project aims at creating a website for students to connect with their alumni in the college and gain knowledge related to their domain. The project will also help the alumni to find out their future prospects in the domain. The website would be interactive as it will have a discussion forum and database for the alumni.
